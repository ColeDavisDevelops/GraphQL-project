## Notes

Dear EOG Resources,

Thank you for being an industry leader in regards to the hiring process. I could not agree more with Jesse's welcoming statement, and it excites me to have the opportunity to prove my skills to an organization that operates so fairly. I look forward to hearing any feedback and to proving to EOG that I can be an example of the value gained from optimizing hiring methods.
